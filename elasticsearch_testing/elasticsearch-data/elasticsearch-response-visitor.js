The goal of the module is to produce enduring strategic-mindedness in students who may otherwise tend to equate cybersecurity with technology-based best practices. This is a stand-alone, self-contained module, with no knowledge prerequisites. It contains three lessons of approximately one hour each. &nbsp;The module can be incorporated into virtually any university-level course.
