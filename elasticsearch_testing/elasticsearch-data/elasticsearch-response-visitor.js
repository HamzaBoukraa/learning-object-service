The basic premise of the module is that human adversaries are what differentiates cybersecurity from other technical disciplines such as computer science, and, therefore, the concept of adversarial thinking is central to cybersecurity. The goal of the module is to produce enduring strategic-mindedness in students who may otherwise tend to equate cybersecurity with technology-based best practices. This is a stand-alone, self-contained module, with no knowledge prerequisites. It contains three lessons of approximately one hour each. &nbsp;The module can be incorporated into virtually any university-level course. This module has been experimentally validated and is the subject of two peer-reviewed journal articles (cited in the syllabus).</p>\n","length":"module","name":"Adversarial Thinking","status":"released"},{"author":{"name":"james ashley","organization":"nice challenge project | california state university, san bernardino"},"collection":"secinj","contributors":[],"date":"1527223900960","description":"<p>The NICE Challenges are hands-on scenarios designed to bring the workforce experience to students before they enter the workforce and are free&nbsp;to U.S. based educational institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Each challenge&nbsp;starts with a scenario written in the form of a task to complete from a fictional superior.
