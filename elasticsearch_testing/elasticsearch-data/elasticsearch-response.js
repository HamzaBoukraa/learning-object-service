            "description": "<p>This curriculum module provides a basic introduction to adversarial thinking, game theory, and behavioral game theory to help develop cybersecurity studentsâ€™ abilities to anticipate the strategic actions of cyber adversaries, including where, when, and how they might attack, and their tactics for evading detection. The basic premise of the module is that human adversaries are what differentiates cybersecurity from other technical disciplines such as computer science, and, therefore, the concept of adversarial thinking is central to cybersecurity. The goal of the module is to produce enduring strategic-mindedness in students who may otherwise tend to equate cybersecurity with technology-based best practices. This is a stand-alone, self-contained module, with no knowledge prerequisites. It contains three lessons of approximately one hour each. &nbsp;The module can be incorporated into virtually any university-level course. This module has been experimentally validated and is the subject of two peer-reviewed journal articles (cited in the syllabus).</p>",
