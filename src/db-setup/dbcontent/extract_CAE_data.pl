# This script is designed to extract "standardLO" information
#   from the CAE document describing IA/CD KU's. It puts it
#   into a tabular format so that a Node script can easily
#   read and insert items into the database.
#
# Before you can run this file, you need to
#   1) get the document:
#       https://www.iad.gov/NIETP/documents/Requirements/CAE-CD_Knowledge_Units.pdf
#   2) convert it into a text file:
#       a - install "ghostscript", if you don't already have it (try "which gs")
#       b - run this command from the directory with the pdf:
#               "gs -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o CAE-CD_Knowledge_Units.txt CAE-CD_Knowledge_Units.pdf"
#           NOTE: there are certainly other ways to convert pdf -> txt,
#                   but this script was designed around the file produced
#                   by the above command, using Ghostscript 9.18
#                   If a newer version does different things...good luck.
#                 If you elect to use a different conversion,
#                   you'll need to adapt this script to the new formatting.
#   3) move the new .txt file to LO Suggestion's 'dbcontent/rawdata' directory
# To actually run the file, run
#       "perl dbcontent/extract_CAE_data.pl" from the LO Suggestion root directory

# PARAMETERS

# Assumptions:
# - the KU name is the text in the line preceding one with "Definition:"
# - all the outcomes associated with the KU are bulleted under "Outcome(s):"
# - the bullet is symbol [239-130-183] and is followed by a space
# - there's a blank line following all outcomes, and none amidst them
# - every time "Outcome(s):" appears, there's at least one outcome
