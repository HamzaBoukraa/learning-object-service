# This script is designed to extract "standardLO" information
#   from the NIST document describing NCWF. It puts it into a
#   tabular format so that a Node script can easily read and
#   insert items into the database.
#
# Before you can run this file, you need to
#   1) get the document:
#       http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181.pdf
#   2) convert it into a text file:
#       a - install "ghostscript", if you don't already have it (try "which gs")
#       b - run this command from the directory with the pdf:
#               "gs -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o NIST.SP.800-181.txt NIST.SP.800-181.pdf"
#           NOTE: there are certainly other ways to convert pdf -> txt,
#                   but this script was designed around the file produced
#                   by the above command, using Ghostscript 9.18
#                   If a newer version does different things...good luck.
#                 If you elect to use a different conversion,
#                   you'll need to adapt this script to the new formatting.
#   3) move the new .txt file to LO Suggestion's 'dbcontent/rawdata' directory
#   4) certain codes (K0098-K0128 andA0161-A0176) have an anomalous
#       margin that throws this script off. Fix this by manually
#       deleting two or three spaces before each of those codes,
#       so that they line up with the codes above them.
#      NOTE: all the skills' margins are slightly off also,
#           but this script accounts for that
#   5) there are unfortunately numerous other problems that we
#       need to fix, but we'll run the script first to know where
# To actually run the file, run
#       "perl dbcontent/extract_NCWF_KSAs.pl" from the root directory
#   It'll do most of the work, but it'll also note that it's missing
#       some entries. That's because the extraction process depends
#       on the descriptions ending with a period, and not all of them
#       do. We'll have to fix that manually, but thanks to the warning
#       messages, we know which ones to fix.
#   NOTE: There are in fact a lot of codes that just don't exist,
#       or have been withdrawn.
#   NOTE: The problem may also be at the start of the description. If it
#       doesn't match one of the phrases in $pattern below, the script
#       will ignore it. Maybe you'd like it to, or maybe there's a
#       grammatical error you can fix.
#   NOTE: There is one description (A0149) which contains a line ending
#       in a period before the description is done. That causes problems,
#       so move that '(e.g.' to the next line with text.
