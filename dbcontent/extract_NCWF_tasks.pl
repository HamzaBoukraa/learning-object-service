# This script is designed to extract "standardLO" information
#   from the NIST document describing NCWF. It puts it into a
#   tabular format so that a Node script can easily read and
#   insert items into the database.
#
# Before you can run this file, you need to
#   1) get the document:
#       http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181.pdf
#   2) convert it into a text file:
#       a - install "ghostscript", if you don't already have it (try "which gs")
#       b - run this command from the directory with the pdf:
#               "gs -sDEVICE=txtwrite -o NIST.SP.800-181.txt NIST.SP.800-181.pdf"
#           NOTE: there are certainly other ways to convert pdf -> txt,
#                   but this script was designed around the file produced
#                   by the above command, using Ghostscript 9.18
#                   If a newer version does different things...good luck.
#                 If you elect to use a different conversion,
#                   you'll need to adapt this script to the new formatting.
#   3) move the new .txt file to LO Suggestion's 'dbcontent/rawdata' directory
#   4) there are unfortunately numerous other problems that we
#       need to fix, but we'll run the script first to know where
# To actually run the file, run
#       "perl dbcontent/extract_NCWF_tasks.pl" from the LO Suggestion root directory
#   It'll do most of the work, but it'll also note that it's missing
#       some entries. That's because the extraction process depends
#       on the descriptions ending with a period, and not all of them
#       do. We'll have to fix that manually, but thanks to the warning
#       messages, we know which ones to fix.
#   NOTE: There are in fact a lot of codes that just don't exist.
#   NOTE: Some of the tasks span a page break, and therefore accrue...extra
#       words. You should delete those page breaks from the framework file.
#   NOTE: Some of the tasks may have been withdrawn. Delete them.
#   NOTE: There is one task (T0021) whose description completes before the
#       code appears. That breaks things, so put them on the same line.
